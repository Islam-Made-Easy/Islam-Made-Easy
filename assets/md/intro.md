# An Introduction To Tawheed and Sunnah 
## according to the understanding of 
# The Salaf of the Ummah

### In the Name of Allāh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful
---
And may the peace and abundant blessings of Allāh be upon Muhammad, his Family,
his Companions and those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Judgment
And thereafter:

# The correct intention
The Prophet (ﷺ) said:

Verily the deeds are (judged) according to their intentions, and verily for every person
there is (the reward of) what he has intended. So whoever performed hijrah to Allāh and
His Messenger, then his hijrah is for Allāh and His Messenger. And whoever performed
hijrah to some dunyā in order to achieve it, or for a woman in order to marry her, then his
hijrah is for that which he performed hijrah for.‛ (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī and Sahīh Muslim)
Verily, the intention of a person can change his deeds from being something that benefits
him, to being something which leads him into destruction. Just as the Prophet (sallAllāhu
‘alayhi wa sallam) informed about this in a hadīth about the events on the Day of Judgment:

And a man, who learned the knowledge, taught it (to others) and recited the Qurān. Then
he will be brought forth and He makes him aware of His blessings, and he acknowledges
them. He will say: ‘What did you do with it?’ He will say: ‘I learned the knowledge and
taught it, and for You I recited the Qurān.’ He will say: ‘You have lied. Rather, you
learned the knowledge so it would be said: He is a scholar. And you recited the Qurān so
it would be said: He is a reciter. And it has verily been said.’ Then orders are given
regarding him, and he is dragged on his face until he is thrown in Hellfire.‛ (Sahīh
Muslim)

So the reader is advised to invoke the Name of Allāh and to correct his intention before
beginning to read this book, and before every deed he performs. The successful is the one
who changes his intention to be solely for Allāh. So whatever he does is only to achieve
the Satisfaction of Allāh and to protect himself from the Wrath of Allāh. As for the one
who seeks knowledge only to discuss, only to find mistakes or to elevate himself to a
higher level by lowering others and pointing out their mistakes, then his intention will
surely render his deeds void, and there will be no benefit in them.

# Introduction
These are simple words describing the fundamentals upon which the religion of Islām is
built. Allāh – the Exalted – has chosen Islām as the religion for His slaves, and He does not
accept anything but it. So whoever wants to meet Allāh in a state which will guarantee
him entrance into Paradise, then he must base his religion in this life upon that which has
been revealed by Allāh to His Messenger (ﷺ), and he must not die
except upon this.

The Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) is Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullāh Al-
Qurashī (ﷺ) who was born in Makkah. He received the revelation
from Allāh – the Exalted – through the angel Jibrīl (‘alayhi as-salām) at the age of forty. Ten
years after the first revelation the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was
taken on a night journey in which the five daily prayers was revealed to him. After this he
(ﷺ) remained in Makkah for another three years after which he
emigrated to Madīnah. Here he continued to invite towards his Lord until Allāh – the
Exalted – took his soul at the age of sixty-three, where he (ﷺ) had
fulfilled his mission. He was buried in Madīnah where his grave is still present. May the
peace and abundant blessings of Allāh be upon the final Prophet and Messenger from
Allāh. Āmīn.

Allāh – the Exalted – has made the religion which He is pleased with very easy, and He –
the Exalted – does not want any difficulty for mankind. Allāh – the Exalted – says:

*“He chose you, and He did not make any difficulty for you in the religion; (which is) the
      millah of Ibrāhīm your father.” **(Al-Hajj 22:78)***

So let not anyone think for a second, that Allāh has made the correct path difficult to spot
among the different types of misguidances, or that Allāh has allowed that a person follows
a way or a path, and then ‚hopes‛ that this is the right path which Allāh is pleased with.
Rather Allāh revealed the Book with clarification and He sent a Messenger to be a bearer
of glad tidings for those who follow the revelation and a warner for those who deviate
from it. He did this in order for a person to be upon yaqīn (full certainty) in his religion
and so his heart may feel the tranquility of being upon the truth and long for the meeting
with its Lord. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

*”There is no compulsion in the religion. Verily have the Straight Path become clear
 from the wrong path.” **(Al-Baqarah 2:256)***
 
And He – the Exalted – said: 
    *”Messengers as bearer of glad tidings and warners. In order that mankind will have no
     argument against Allāh after the messengers. And Allāh is ever Almighty and All-Wise.”
     **(An-Nisā 4:165)***

And He – the Exalted – said:
    *”He arranges the affairs (and) explains the āyāt (evidences, verses, signs) in details, in
     order for you to have full certainty in the meeting with your Lord.” **(Ar-Ra’d 13:2)***
  
And He – the Exalted – said:
    *“Verily the believers are those who believe in Allāh, and thereafter do not doubt.”
     **(Al-Hujurāt 49:15)***

And the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) said:

*I have verily left you upon a clear path. Its night is like its day. No-one deviates from it
 after me, except that he will be destroyed.‛ **(Sunan Ibn Mājah – sahīh)***
 
And that which the Messenger (ﷺ) has left for us, is the Qurān the
Word of Allāh, which was sent by Allāh through Jibrīl (‘alayhi as-salām) to Muhammad
(ﷺ), and the Sunnah which is everything which the Prophet
(ﷺ) has said, done, showed to us and confirmed.
So the intended with this text is to clarify the fundamental principles based upon which
this religion is built in an easy, simple and categorized way, so the Muslim may know how

to seek his religion, from whom and from where he should accept and from whom and
from where he should reject, and for him to have a template with which he can verify
whether or not that which he believes in is correct and thereby achieve full certainty in his
religion. As for each individual issue mentioned, then this text only suffices as a short
introduction.

All success is from Allāh, while all mistakes are from the author.


# The sources of the religion

Al-Islām is built upon two primary sources 1 , and that is the Qurān and the Sunnah.
Everything which does not have its foundation in any of these two, then it is misguidance
and rejected for the one who believes in it.

### But can anyone understand the Qurān and the Sunnah as he wishes or desires? The answer is no.

Allāh – the Exalted – chose to reveal His religion upon a people who – by the permission
of Allāh – were capable of comprehending it, following it and protecting it. Allāh – the
Exalted – testified to the righteousness of those generations several places in His Book.
From this testimony are His – the Exalted – words:

 *“And whoever contradicts (or opposes) the Messenger after the right path has been
 shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers' way. We shall keep him on
 the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination.” **(An-Nisā 4:115)***
 
And His – the Exalted – words:
    *“And the first forerunners (in īmān) among the Muhājirīn and the Ansār and those who
     followed them in goodness. Allāh is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him,
     and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will
     abide forever. That is the great attainment.” **(At-Tawbah 9:100)***
    
And the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) said:
    *The best people are those of my generation, then those who come after them, then those
     who come after them. **(Sahīh Al-Bukhārī and Sahīh Muslim)***
     
The generation of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) is the Sahābah
(رضي‬ الله عنهم‬) who lived with and saw the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu ‘alayhi wa
sallam). They understood the Qurān and the Sunnah best, because they lived during its
revelation, they experienced the scenarios which it spoke of and they are those who were
closest to the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), asking him questions,
hearing his speech and seeing his deeds.
The generation after them is the tābi’ūn (the followers) who are those who learned from
the Sahābah (رضي‬ الله عنهم‬). Thus their status in the religion is based upon them
learning from the Sahābah who learned from the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu ‘alayhi wa
sallam).

The generations after them is the tābi’ at-tābi’īn (the followers of the followers) who are
those who learned from the followers of the Sahābah (رضي‬ الله عنهم‬). Thus their status
in the religion is based upon them learning from the tābi’ūn, who learned from the Sahābah
who learned from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ).
These are the three generations whom the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ)
has described as the best of generations from this Ummah, and they are our Salaf
(predecessors). So whoever wants to follow that which Allāh is pleased with and love, he
must follow these three generations in their religion, whose sources are directly from the
Qurān and Sunnah. Because there will never be any people after them who are better.

Anas Ibn Mālik (رضي‬ الله عنه‬) said:

*Have patience. Because verily there will not come a time upon you, except that (the time) after it is
 worse than it. Until you meet you Lord. I heard that from your Prophet (sallAllāhu ‘alayhi wa
 sallam).* **(Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)**
 
And ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas’ūd (رضي‬ الله عنه‬) said: 

   *There is no year except that the year after it is worse than it. I am not speaking about one year
    which has more rain than another, nor a year which is more fertile than another, nor a leader which
    is better than another leader. Rather (I am speaking about) the disappearance of the best people
    among you and your scholars, and then a people will emerge who measure the affairs according to
    their own opinion (and not the Qurān and Sunnah), and then Islām will be destroyed and broken.
    **(Al-Bida’ by Ibn Al-Waddāh)***
     
So the people of truth are those who say:
**"We follow and believe in the Qurān and the Sunnah, according to the understanding of the Salaf."**

And this is not merely a statement with them. Rather there is not a verse in the Book of
Allāh, or a hadīth from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), or any belief
which is held in the religion, except that they investigate and ask:
Is this how the Salaf have understood and acted upon this verse?
Is this how the Salaf have understood and acted upon this hadīth?
Is this how the Salaf have believed in this issue?
With this they uphold the boundaries of Islām by not letting any form of misguidance nor
innovation enter upon them in their religion. And with this they are truthful in their claim
of following the Qurān and Sunnah in accordance with the understanding of the Salaf. And
with this they can profess to be followers of and believers in Tawhīd and Sunnah in reality,
and not just as an empty claim with no substance to it.
Abū Bakr Al-Ājurrī (d. 320h) gathered the meaning of what have been mentioned in this
section when he mentioned:

   *And Ibn ‘Abdul-Hamīd also narrated to us and said: Zuhayr ibn Muhammad narrated to us and
     said: Sulaymān ibn Harb narrated to us and said: Hammād ibn Zayd narrated to us, from ‘Āsim
     Al-Ahwal who said: Abū Al-‘Āliyah said: ‘Learn Al-Islām, and then when you have learned it then
     don’t turn away from it. And it is upon you to follow the Straight Path, and verily is it Al-Islām.
     And do not deviate from it right or left. And it is upon you to follow the Sunnah of your Prophet
     (ﷺ) and that which his Companions are upon. Because verily did we read
     the Qurān fifteen years before they did what they did. And be aware of these desires (i.e.
     innovations) which cause enmity and hatred among the people.’ He said: ‘So I narrated it (i.e. these
     words) to Al-Hasan, so he said: ‘He has spoken the truth and given a good advice.’ And I narrated
     it to Hafsah bint Sīrīn, so she said: ‘O my son, have you narrated this to Muhammad (ibn Sīrīn)?’
     So I said: ‘No.’ So she said: ‘Then narrate it to him.’’ And Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan said: ‘The
     sign of the one whom Allāh wants good for is: Traversing this Path: The Book of Allāh, the Sunan
     of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), the Sunan (i.e. narrations) from his
     Companions (رضي‬ الله عنه‬) and those who followed them in goodness, and that which the
     aimmah (leaders) of the Muslims in all countries were upon, until the end of what there was of
     scholars. Such as Al-Awzā’ī, Sufyān Ath-Thawrī, Mālik ibn Anas, Ash-Shāfi’ī, Ahmad ibn Hanbal,
     Al-Qāsim ibn Salām, and whoever were upon the same path as them. And avoiding every madhhab
     (way, path, opinion) which these scholars have criticized. **(Ash-Sharī’ah by Al-Ājurrī 1/301)***
     
 And Abū ‘Amr Al-Awzā’ī (d. 157h) said:
 
   *And I advise you to one thing, which verily will remove the doubt from you, and by holding on to
     it you will achieve the Straight Path, if Allāh – the Exalted – wills: You look into what the
     Companions of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) were upon in this issue. Then
     if they differed in it, then take whatever agrees with you from their sayings. In that case you will be
     at ease in the issue. And if they agreed in the issue upon one opinion, and no-one among them
     deviated from it, then to where is the madhhab that opposes them? Because verily the destruction
     lies is disagreeing with them. Because they have verily never agreed upon one issue, and then the
     guidance (i.e. truth) has been in something else than it. And verily did Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla –
     praise those who followed their example, when He said: ‚And those who followed them in
     goodness.‛ (At-Tawbah 9:100). And be aware of everyone who interprets the Qurān to
     something else than what they were upon. **(Al-Ibānah Al-Kubrā by Ibn Battah 2/254)***
     
 And Al-Awzā’ī (d. 157h) also said:
 
   *It is obligatory upon you (to follow) the āthār (narrations) of those who came before, even if the
     people would reject you. And be aware of the opinions of men, even if they beautify their words for
     you. **(Ash-Sharī’ah by Al-Ājurrī)***
     
 And Abū Sa’īd Ad-Dārimī (d. 280h) said:
 
   *Allāh – the Exalted – praised the tābi’ūn in His Book, when He said: ‚And the first forerunners
     (in īmān) among the Muhājirīn and the Ansār and those who followed them in
     goodness. Allāh is pleased with them.‛ So He testified to their following of the Sahābah, and
     them deserving the Pleasure of Allāh – the Exalted – due to their following of the Companions of
     Muhammad (ﷺ). And the word is united among all the Muslims that
     they were called ‘At-Tābi’ūn’ and they continue to narrate from them with the chains of narration,
     just as they narrated from the Sahābah. And they use them as an argument in the affairs of their
     religion, and they consider their opinion more binding than the opinion of those who came after
     them, due to the name which they deserved from Allāh – the Exalted – and from the Jamā’ah of the
     Muslims, who called them the followers of the Companions of Muhammad (sallAllāhu ‘alayhi wa
     sallam). **(An-Naqd by Ad-Dārimī)***
     
 And Abū Al-Qāsim Al-Lālakāī (d. 81< h) said:
 
   *I use as evidence for the madhāhib (pl. madhhab) of Ahlus-Sunnah that which is mentioned in the
     Book of Allāh – the Exalted – regarding it, and that which is narrated from the Messenger of Allāh
     (ﷺ). So if I find something in both of them, then I mention it all. And if I
     find something in only one of them without the other, then I mention that. And if I don’t find
     anything regarding it except from the Sahābah (رضي‬ الله عنهم‬); those whom Allāh and His
     Messenger has ordered to take as an example, and to follow their words, and to seek light from their
     lights, due to them testifying the revelation and their knowledge regarding the meaning of the
     interpretations, then I use that as evidence. But if there is no narration regarding it from a
     companion, then from those who followed them in goodness; those in whose words there is a cure
     and guidance. And worshipping Allāh with their opinion is nearness to Allāh and closeness (to
     Him). So if we see that they agreed upon something then we rely on it. And whoever’s opinion they
     criticized, or they refuted his bid’ah (innovation) or they declared takfīr upon him, then we will
     judge with that and believe in it. And there continue to be, from the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu
     ‘alayhi wa sallam) until this day of ours, a people who protect this way and take it as their religion.
     And verily is the person destroyed who turns away from this path, due to his ignorance regarding
     the path of following (the narratins). **(Usūl I’tiqād Ahlus-Sunnah by Al-Lālakāī 1/27)***
     
So these are the words from Allāh the Exalted, His Messenger (ﷺ),
the Sahābah (رضي‬ الله عنهم‬) and the scholars of Islām which all points to, that the
religion is what has come in the Qurān and the Sunnah, according to the understanding of
the Salaf. And that is a path of submitting to and following the evidences and narrations.
May Allāh make us from them. Āmīn.


# The testimonies of Islām (At-Tawhīd and Ar-Risālah)

The Muslim enters into the religion with the two testimonies. If he meets Allāh based
upon their true meanings and having fulfilled their requirements, then Allāh has
promised to enter him into Paradise. These two testimonies are: **Lā ilāha illa Allāh** (there
is no-one worthy of worship besides Allāh), **Muhammadun RasulAllāh** (Muhammad is
the Messenger of Allāh).

*Lā ilāha illa Allāh* being the Tawhīd (Oneness) of Allāh which every prophet and messenger
– from Nūh (‘alayhi as-salām) to Muhammad (ﷺ) – has been sent
inviting towards, while *Muhammadun RasūlAllāh* is the Risālah (Message) which is the
legislation and knowledge which is specific to Muhammad (ﷺ).
There is nothing that the Muslim does in his religion except that it has a relation to these
two testimonies. And this is due to the fact that every act of worship – both in deeds and
beliefs – **has two conditions for it to accepted by Allāh**:

  1. That it is performed with ikhlās which is sincerity in intention, meaning that it is
    solely performed for Allāh without including any form of major or minor shirk,
    which is associating partners with Allāh in worship or in intention.
  2. That it is performed according to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu
    ‘alayhi wa sallam), meaning that it is performed without any form of innovation.

Thus, whoever bears witness to **Lā ilāha illa Allāh, Muhammadun RasūlAllāh**, has born
witness to the fact, that he only worships one *ilāh* (deity, god) – both in beliefs and in
deeds – and that he only worships Allāh the same way that His Messenger *(ﷺ)* has shown us, both in beliefs and in deeds. Therefore a person cannot be
a Muslim who is free from *shirk* (i.e. associating partners with Allāh in worship) and *bida’*
(innovation), without knowing the true meaning of these two testimonies, believing in
their meanings, acting upon them and avoiding whatever negates them.

And one of these testimonies do not benefit without the other. Whoever worships Allāh
alone, but does not believe in the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) nor
follow his path, then he is not a Muslim. And whoever believes in the Messenger of Allāh
(ﷺ) but does not worship Allāh alone – by associating partners
with Him in worship – then he is not a Muslim. Furthermore the two testimonies are
undeniably related to each other, which mean that nullifying one of them automatically
means nullifying the other, which will become evident in this book.

# The first testimony: *Lā ilāha illa Allāh*

Every type of worship in Islām has its pillars and its conditions which must be fulfilled in
order for it to be accepted. For the prayer to be accepted its conditions must be fulfilled
such as being sane, being of age, being in a state of ritual purity, having covered the *‘awrah*
etc. And when the conditions are fulfilled it will be accepted from the slave when he
performs the pillars of the prayer, such as the first *takbīrah* (the saying of *‘Allāhu akbar’* at
the beginning of the prayer), the Fātihah (the first *sūrah* of the Qurān, which must be
recited in each unit of the prayer), the *rukū’* (the bowing), the *sujūd* (the prostration) etc.

Likewise it is with the biggest and most noble of worships; the testimony of ***Lā ilāha illa
Allāh.*** The conditions for *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* are seven:

  1. ***Ikhlās;*** that it is said sincerely for Allāh alone. This negates ***shirk*** (associating
  partners with Allāh in worship) and ***riyā*** (showing off or performing deeds to
  achieve praise).
  2. ***Sidq;*** that it is said truthfully while meaning it. This negates ***nifāq*** (showing or
  saying something outwardly while hiding the opposite inside).
  3. ***Qabūl;*** that a person accepts the meaning of it and what it requires of deeds and
  beliefs. This negates **rejection.**
  4. ***‘Ilm;*** that it is said while having knowledge about what it means, necessitates and
  what negates it. This negates **ignorance.**
  5. ***Inqiyād;*** that it is said while submitting to and acting upon its meaning and
  requirements. This negates **leaving.**
  6. ***Mahabbah;*** that a person loves its meaning. This negates **hatred.**
  7. ***Yaqīn;*** that it is said with certain faith in its meaning. This negates **doubt.**

It was said to Wahb ibn Munabbih (d. 114h):

*"Is Lā ilāha illa Allāh not the key to Paradise? So he (i.e. Wahb) said: ‘Yes certainly. But there is no
 key except that it has teeth. So if you come with the key and it has teeth then (the door) will be
 opened for you. And if not, then it will not be opened for you." **(Al-Bukhārī)***
 
When these conditions are fulfilled by the slave then his performance of and belief in the
pillars of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* will be accepted. But as for the one who says *Lā ilāha illa Allāh,*
but he does not do this sincerely for Allāh, rather he does it for other reasons, or he says it
while not meaning it, or he does not accept or submit to its meaning, or he is ignorant  
about what it means and necessitates, or he hates it or doubts whether it is the truth or not,
then the testimony of this person will not benefit him on the Day of Judgment, even
though he was considered a Muslim in *dunyā* and treated accordingly due to not openly
showing any nullifiers of Islām or that he negated any of these conditions.

As for the pillars of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh*, then the testimony of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* is made up by
two pillars:

  The first is: ***Lā ilāha.*** Translated this means: ‘There is no *ilāh* (worshipped)’, and what is
  intended is: ‘There is no-one who with right is worshipped’. And this is the part of the
  testimony which negates divinity (or worthiness of worship) for everything. And it is also
  called *al-kufr bit-tāghūt*, which means the rejection of *tāghūt* (something which is worshipped besides Allāh).
  
  The second is: ***Illa Allāh.*** Translated this means: ‘Besides Allāh.’ And this is the part of the
  testimony which affirms the divinity (or worthiness of worship) for Allāh alone. And it is
  also called *al-imānu billāh* (the belief in Allāh)
  
And among the evidences for these two pillars are the words of Allāh the Exalted:

**“Whoever disbelieves in** [or rejects] ***tāghūt*** **and believes in Allāh, then he has grasped
the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allāh is All-Hearer, All-
Knower.”** [Al-Baqarah 2:256]

And His – the Exalted – words:

**“And verily, We have sent among every *Ummah*** (nation) **a Messenger** (proclaiming):
**‘Worship Allāh** (Alone), **and avoid** (or keep away from) ***tāghūt*** (everything worshipped
besides Allāh).’” (An-Nahl 16:36)

And His – the Exalted – words:

**“And those who avoid *tāghūt* by not worshipping it, and turn in repentance to Allāh, for
them are the glad tidings. So give the glad tidings to My slaves.”** (Az-Zumar 39:17)

What easily can be understood from these verses – and that which is already known by
mankind through the *fitrah* (natural disposition) – is that Allāh demands from His creation
that they worship Him alone, and do not associate any partners with Him the Exalted.

Mu’ādh ibn Jabal (رضي‬ الله عنه‬) said:

***"I said: ‘O Messenger of Allāh, tell me of an act which will take me into Paradise and will
keep me away from Hell fire.’ He said: ‘You have asked me about a major matter, yet it is
easy for him for whom Allāh Almighty makes it easy. You should worship Allāh, and not
associate anything with Him (in worship), you should perform the prayers, you should
pay the zakāt, you should fast in Ramadān, and you should make the pilgrimage to the
House.’"*** (Sunan At-Tirmidhī – sahīh)

And ’Abdullāh ibn ‘Amr (رضي‬ الله عنه‬) narrated that the Prophet (sallAllāhu ‘alayhi wa
sallam) said:

***"Whoever meets Allāh without having associated partners with Him (in worship), then
with that (being fulfilled) no mistake (or sin) will harm him. And whoever dies while he
has associating something with Him (in worship), then no good deed will benefit along
with that."*** (Narrated by Imām Ahmad – Its isnād is correct according to the conditions of
Al-Bukhārī and Muslim)

And Ibn Jarīr At-Tabarī (d. 310h) said in his *tafsīr* of the following verse:

**“And your ilāh is One Ilāh. Lā ilāha illa Huwa (there is no-one worthy of worship besides
  Him). The Most Merciful, the Most Beneficent.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:163)
  
*"Regarding His words: There is no-one worthy of worship besides Him, then this is an information
from Him – uplifted is His mention – that there is no Lord of the Worlds besides Him. Nor does
anything besides Him deserve the worship of the slaves. And that everything which exists besides
Him, then He has created it. And that which is obligatory for all of them is obeying Him and
submitting to His order, and leaving the worship of what is beside Him of rivals and false gods, and
leaving the idols and statues. This is because He has created all of this. And (obligatory) upon all of
them is dedicating the religion for Him through the wahdāniyyah (oneness) and the ulūhiyyah
(worship), and the worship is not suitable for anyone but Him."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

The Qurān, the Sunnah, the words of the *Sahābah* and those who followed them, are filled
with this meaning; that *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* means the worthiness of worship for Allāh alone.
So no-one can claim ignorance in this issue, rather the one who is ignorant or misguided in
this issue due to following something else than these sources, then he has only himself to
blame, and on the Day of Judgment he will not be excused for committing *shirk* with
Allāh.

Abū Muhammad Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And know – may Allāh have mercy upon you – that the religion is what has come from Allāh –
tabāraka wa ta’ālā – and it was not put upon the intellects of men and their opinions. And its (i.e.
the religion) knowledge is with Allāh and with His Messenger, so do not follow anything with you
desires so you will pass through the religion and leave Islām, because there is no excuse for you.
Verily did the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) clarify the Sunnah for his Ummah
and he made it clear for his Companions, and they are the Jamā’ah, and they are As-Sawād Al-
A’dham, and As-Sawād Al-A’dham is the truth and its people. So whoever opposes the companions
of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) in anything from issues of the religion then
he has committed kufr."* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)

The best of all good deeds is Tawhīd (worshipping Allāh alone) while the worst of all evil
deeds is *shirk* (worshipping others than Allāh).


# The first pillar: *Al-Kufr bit-Tāghūt* (the rejection of *tāghūt*)

First of all *tāghūt* means someone who has transgressed his, hers or its boundaries. In the
Islāmic context *tāghūt* means something which has transgressed its boundaries by being
worshipped, obeyed or followed besides Allāh. This does not apply for the one who is not
pleased with being worshipped and disassociates himself from this worship.

Ibn Wahb (d. 197h) said:

*"Mālik (i.e. Imām Mālik) said to me: ‘At-Tāghūt is what they worship besides Allāh."* (Tafsīr Ibn
Abū Hātim)

The head of all *tawāghīt* (pl. *tāghūt*) is Iblīs who is the Shaytān (devil). He refused to obey
Allāh in prostrating to Ādam when Allāh created him with His two Hands. Thus he was
expelled from Paradise, rejected, humiliated and cursed, and he swore to mislead as many
from the children of Ādam as possible by making them commit *shirk, kufr* and sins. Many
will follow his encouragements to evil, and on the Day of Resurrection he will disassociate
himself from those whom he misled and he will not be able to help them with anything.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”When your Lord said to the angels: ‘I will verily create a person from clay. So when I
have made him and breated into him (his) soul I have created, then fall down in
prostration to him. So the angels prostrated all of them. Except Iblīs he was arrogant
and was among the disbelievers. He (i.e. Allāh) said: ‘O Iblīs, what prevented you from
prostrating to what I have created with My two Hands? Did you become too arrogant (to
prostrate) or were you (already) among the haughty?’ He said: ‘I am better than him, You
have created me from fire and You created him from clay.’ He said: ‘Then go out from it
(i.e. Paradise), because you are verily expelled. And verily is My curse upon you until the
Day of Judgment.’ He said: ‘My Lord, then give me respite until the Day they are
resurrected.’ He said: ‘Then you are verily among those given respite. Until the Day of
an appointed time.’ He said: ‘By Your Might, I will verily lead them all astray. Except
your slaves among them who have been given sincerity (in the worship of You).”** (Sād
38:71-83)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”As the example of the *Shaytān* when he says to the human: ‘Commit *kufr.*’ Then when
he commits *kufr* he says: ‘I am verily free from you, I verily fear Allāh the Lord of all the
worlds.”** (Al-Hashr 59:16)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And the *Shaytān* said when the affairs have been decided (on the Day of Resurrection):
  ‘Verily Allāh promised you a promise of truth, and I also promised you but I broke my
  promise to you. And I did not have any authority over you except that I invited you (to
  evil) and then you answered me (voluntarily). So do not blame me, and blame
  yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I verily reject when you associated
  me as a partner (with Allāh in worship) before. Verily the unjust will have a painful
  punishment.’”** (Ibrāhīm 14:22)
  
Some examples of *tāghūt* which are found today are the following:

* The one who is worshipped besides Allāh or is satisfied with being worshipped with any
type of worship. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”Have I not enjoined upon you, O son of Ādam, that you should not worship the
*Shaytān*? He is verily a clear enemy for you.”** (Yāsīn 36:60)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**”And whoever among them says: ‘I am verily an *ilāh* (deity) besides Him’, such a person
We will recompense with Hellfire. Such do we recompense the unjust.”** (Al-Anbiyā 21:29)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And verily, We have sent among every *Ummah*** (nation) **a Messenger** (proclaiming):
  **‘Worship Allāh** (Alone), **and avoid** (or keep away from) ***tāghūt*** (everything worshipped
  **besides Allāh).’”** (An-Nahl 16:36)
  
* The one who changes the *hukm* (judgment) of Allāh, such as the one who gives a *fatwā*
(verdict) or passes a law stating that *zinā* (fornication) is allowed, or he says that the one
who commits *shirk* is a Muslim. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“Have you not seen those who claim to believe in what was revealed to you and what
was revealed to those who came before you, they wish to seek judgment with the
*tāghūt*, and they were verily ordered to reject them. And the *Shaytān* wishes to
misguide them into a great misguidance.”** (An-Nisā 4:60)

* The one who judges or rules between people with manmade laws that contradict the
*Sharī’ah* and have its basis in other legislations than the *Sharī’ah.* Such as presidents,
parliamentarians, political leaders and everyone who takes part in legislative bodies whose
foundation is other than the Shari’ah, such as democracy, secularism, communism etc.
Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And whoever does not judge with what Allāh has revealed, then these are the
  disbelievers.”** (Al-Māidah 5:44)
  
* The one who claims to know the unseen, so people come and ask him about that. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“Say: ‘Those who are in the heavens and the earth do not know the unseen, except Allāh.”** (An-Naml 27:65)

* The one whom people believe can benefit and harm like Allāh can benefit and harm, so
they ask him for benefit and seek refuge with him from harm, and he does not reject this,
or the dead people in the graves and tombs whom are sought and invoked in these issues.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“He invokes besides Allāh, that which does not harm him and that which does not
  benefit him. That is the far away misguidance.”** (Al-Hajj 22:12)
  
* Nationalism, when people love and hate, and ally and show enmity based upon
nationality and not for the sake of Allāh, then nationality has become a *tāghūt* for them
which they worship. And this is when a person prefers the disbelieving people of his own
nationality over the Muslims, and helps them against them and claims that they are better
than the Muslims due to their nationality.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”O you who believe, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies, they are verily the
allies of one another. And whoever of you takes them as allies, then he is verily one of
them. Verily Allāh does not guide an unjust people.”** (Al-Māidah 5:51)

* Whims and desires. Many ignorant people say: *"I feel that if I do this and that then I am a
good person and Allāh will not punish me."* This, while he is performing things that nullify his
Islām. With this he has made his own whims and desires his *ilāh*, due to believing in it
rather than believing in the Islāmic texts. He also becomes a *kāfir* and a worshipper of his
own desires, if he commits sins due to the belief that the *Sharī’ah* is not binding upon him,
or he changes the judgments according to his desires.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”Have you seen the one who takes his desires as his *ilāh* (worshipped one)?”** (Al-Furqān
  25:43)
  
The detailed meaning of ***al-kufr bit-tāghūt*** can be found in the following verses:

**“Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrāhīm and those with him,
  when they said to their people: ‘Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship
  besides Allāh, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility
  and hatred for ever, until you believe in Allāh Alone.’”** (Al-Mumtahanah 60:4)
  
And His – the Exalted – words:

**“That is because Allāh He is the Truth, and that which they invoke besides Him is the
  falsehood. And that Allāh He is Most High, the Great.”** (Al-Hajj 22:62)
  
And His – the Exalted – words:

**“And they worship besides Allāh that which do not benefit them nor harm them. And
  the disbeliever is ever a helper (of the Shaytān) against his Lord."** (Al-Furqān 25:55)
  
And that which is required is:

- Leaving the worship of the *tāghūt*.
- The rejection of the divinity for *tāghūt*, because they are falsehood.
- The rejection of the worship performed to *tāghūt* by believing it is invalid and void
and that the *tāghūt* does not bring about benefit or harm.
- The rejection of those who worship *tāghūt* by knowing they are not Muslims.
- Hating these people and what they worship.
- Having enmity towards them.

And as for saying to a *mushrik* (one who commits *shirk*) to his face that he is a *mushrik* or a
*kāfir*, or showing him enmity and hatred openly in speech and deeds, then this is
dependent upon the principle of *masālih* (benefits) and *mafāsid* (harms) according to the
rules of the *Sharī’ah.*

That which is enough for a person to be a Muwahhid (one who only worships Allāh) is,
that he leaves the worship of *tāghūt*, he rejects divinity for them, he knows that the *tāghūt*
neither brings benefit nor harm through the worship of them [Naturally the one who worships the *tāghūt* and dies upon this, will suffer the great harm of entering and
                                                             remaining in Hellfire forever. What is meant here is that the worshipped *tāghūt* cannot cause harm to the
                                                             slave in this life, just as he cannot benefit him. Rather all harm and benefit is a decree from Allāh.], and that he knows and
believes that whoever worships something else than Allāh, then he is a *mushrik* and not a
Muslim, and that he hates the *mushrikūn* (those who commit *shirk*).

Whoever does not fulfill this pillar as it has been described he has not rejected *tāghūt,* and
by that he is a *mushrik* and not a Muslim.

And the best way of learning *al-kufr bit-tāghūt* is acquiring knowledge about Allāh, the
belief in Him, the worship of Him, His Names and His Attributes and then not dedicating
any of this to others than Him the Most High.

# Declaring *takfīr* upon the *mushrik*

Allāh has created mankind upon *fitrah* (natural disposition) through which they know
their Lord and His Tawhīd [This does not apply to the Names and Attributes of Allāh which can only be known through the texts of Qurān and *Sunnah.* This is mentioned in the section of Tawhīd Al-Asmā was-Sifāt.] . Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And** (remember) **when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Ādam, from their
  loins, their seed** (or from Ādam’s loin his offspring) **and made them testify as to
  themselves** (saying): **‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said: ‘Yes, we testify.’ In order for you
  not to say on the Day of Resurrection: ‘Verily, we have been unaware of this.’ Or that
  you would say: ‘Verily did our forefathers commit shirk before, and we were** (merely)
  **offspring after them. So will you destroy us for something which the doers of falsehood
  did?”** (Al-A’rāf 7:172-173)
  
And He – the Exalted – said:

**“So direct your face toward the religion, *hanīf*** (i.e. free from shirk)**.** (This is) **the *fitrah* of
  Allāh upon which He has created all people. No change should there be in the creation
  of Allāh. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.”**
  (Ar-Rūm 30:30)
  
Through the *fitrah* a person knows the ugliness of *shirk* and that only Allāh is worthy of
worship. He furthermore knows that the one who worships other than Allāh is not a
Muslim who only worships One God. Thus, if you ask a person – who has not been
corrupted by the doubts and arguments of *Shaytān* and his disciple among mankind – if
the person worshipping others than Allāh is a monotheist, he will surely say: 'No‛. And
whoever is not a monotheist, then he inevitably is a polytheist (i.e. a *mushrik).

Furthermore, when the first pillar of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* is leaving the worship of *tāghūt*
(anything which is worshipped besides Allāh), then the one who commits *shirk* by
worshipping the *tāghūt,* naturally has not fulfilled this pillar of the testimony and his
testimony is invalid, just as if a person would leave out making *sujūd* in his prayer, then
his prayer would also be invalid due to not having fulfilled a pillar of the prayer.

Add to this that in the Arabic language the one who performs the deed of shirk, by
worshipping others than Allāh, he is given the name *mushrik.* And only a person who does
not know the rules of the Arabic language refuses to name the person committing shirk as
a *mushrik.*

And the conclusion is, that the one who refuses to declare *takfīr* upon the *mushrik* (i.e. he
refuses to consider the person committing *shirk* as being a non-muslim), he has opposed
the *fitrah,* the evidences, the language and common sense. Allāh – the Exalted – testified to
and explained this fact when He clarified the impossibility of the one worshipping only
Allāh being equal to the one worshipping others along with Allāh:

**“Allāh gave an example of a** (slave) **man belonging to many partners disputing with one
  another, and a** (slave) **man belonging entirely to one master. Are those two equal in
  comparison? All praise is due to Allāh. But most of them do not know.”** (Az-Zumar 39:29)
  
At-Tabarī (d. 310h) said in his *tafsīr* of this verse:

*"He – exalted is His mention – says: Allāh gave an example of the kāfir billāh (disbeliever in Allāh)
who worships different deities, and obeys a group of the shayātīn (devils). And (an example) of the
believer who do not worship anyone besides Allāh." (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

And he also mentioned in his *tafsīr* of the verse:

*"Bishr narrated to us and said: Yazīd narrated to us and said: Sa’īd narrated to us, from Qatādah
 (regarding) His words:* **"Allāh gave an example of a (slave) man belonging to many 
 partners disputing with one another."** *He said: ‘This is the mushrik regarding whom the
 shayātīn (devils) dispute, none of them acknowledges him (as belonging) to anyone among them.*
 **"And a (slave) man belonging entirely to one master."** *He said: ‘This is the believer who
 sincerily devotes the invocation and worship (to Allāh).’"* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)
 
As for telling the *mushrik* to his face that he is not a Muslim, then this is not a must for
having fulfilled the *takfīr*, but it is a must that he believes that the one who commits *shirk* is
upon *kufr* and not upon Islām. Allāh has clearly described the one who ascribes partners
and rivals with Allāh in worship as being upon *kufr,* when He – the Exalted – said:

**“And he sets up rivals to Allāh, in order to mislead others from His Path. Say: ‘Take
  pleasure in your *kufr*** (disbelief) **for a while: surely, you are among the dwellers of
  Hellfire.”** (Az-Zumar 39:8)
  
And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And whoever invokes** (or worships), **besides Allāh, any other ilāh** (deity), **of whom he
  has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Verily the *kāfirūn*** (the
  disbelievers) **will not be successful.”** (Al-Muminūn 23:117)
  
And the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) also testified that whoever dies
upon *shirk,* he will enter Hellfire. And no-one enters Hellfire forever except a *kāfir.*
‘Abdullāh ibn Mas’ūd (رضي‬ الله عنه‬) said:

**"*The Prophet (ﷺ) said one thing, and I said another thing. The
  Prophet (ﷺ) said: ‘Wheoever dies, and he is invoking a rival
  besides Allāh, he will enter Hellfire.’ And I said: ‘Whoever dies, and he does not invoke a
  rival with Allāh, he will enter Paradise."*** (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)
  
Add to this that the Prophet (ﷺ) would connect the *hukm*
(judgment) of Islām in *dunyā* with the fact that a person does not worship anything else
but Allāh [This is in what is showed publicly. If he hides his *shirk* and *kufr* and shows Islām outwardly, then he is munāfiq and the judgment of Islām is still applied upon him.].

The Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) said:

***"Whoever says: Lā ilāha illa Allāh and rejects everything which is worshipped besides
   Allāh, his wealth and blood becomes impermissible (to take) and his account is with
   Allāh."*** And in another version: ***"Whoever singles out Allāh (in worship)."*** And then he
   mentioned the same. (Sahīh Muslim)
   
So the condition for acquiring the *hukm* (judgment) of Islām in *dunyā* is that he testifies to
*Lā ilahā illa Allāh* and that he rejects everything which is worshipped besides Allāh, by not
worshipping it. Thus, if he worships something else than Allāh – or shows another *nāqid*
(nullifier) among the *nawāqid* of Islām – then the judgment of Islām is removed from him,
due to him not having fulfilled the conditions for acquiring this judgment.
So the issue of *takfīr al-mushrik* (declaring *takfīr* upon the one who commits *shirk*) is very
easy for the people of truth, since the answer to this issue is clearly stated in the Qurān
and the *Sunnah.*

Al-Barbahārī (d. 329h) said:

*"And no-one from the people of the Qiblah (i.e. those who pray) are exited from Islām (i.e. declared
 takfīr upon) before he rejects a verse from the Book of Allāh – the Exalted – or he rejects something
 of the narrations of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ), or he prays to other than
 Allāh, or he slaughters for others than Allāh. But if he does any of these things, then it is obligatory
 upon you to exit him from Islām."* (Sharh As-Sunnah by Al-Barbahārī)
 

# Excuse in ignorance and the one who considers the *mushrik* a Muslim

Allāh did not excuse a person in ignorance, neither did His Messenger (ﷺ) and therefore a Muslim also do not excuse the one who commits *shirk* due to
ignorance.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And if anyone of the *mushrikūn*** (those who commit *shirk*) **seeks your protection then
  grant him protection, so that he may hear the Word of Allāh** (i.e. the Qurān), **and then
  escort him to where he can be secure, that is because they are men who know not.”**
  (At-Tawbah 9:6)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Those who disbelieve from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and
among the *mushrikūn,* were not going to leave (their disbelief) until the clear evidence
comes to them.”** (Al-Bayyinah 98:1)

In both of these verses Allāh gives the name *mushrik* to those who ascribe partners and
rivals to Him in worship before the evidence having reached them, being the Qurān and
the Messenger (ﷺ). So if these people were not excused how can
anyone claim that a person who claims to be a Muslim, recites the Qurān, mentions the
ahādīth and lives among the Muslims, is entitled to being excused when Allāh did not
excuse those whom the Book and Messenger did not reach yet?

Furthermore the Prophet (ﷺ) said in a sahīh hadīth narrated by Abū
Hurayrah (رضي‬ الله عنه‬):

***"By the One whose Hand Muhammad’s soul is in, no-one from this Ummah, neither a Jew
   nor a Christian hears about me, and then do not believe in what I have been sent with,
   except that he is from the people of the fire."*** (Sahīh Muslim)
   

So whoever among the Jews, Christians, Majūs, Buddhists, Atheists and all others in this
life who heard about the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) and then dies
upon something else than the Tawhīd of Allāh and the Risālah of Muhammad (ﷺ), then he will be in Hellfire. Then how daring and how ignorant is it, to
claim that a person who claims to be a Muslim and then breaches his Tawhīd by
committing *shirk* is excused while the above mentioned are going to Hellfire?

Add to this that if a person should pray his prayer while being ignorant about the fact that
the prayer contains the performance of *sujūd* so he does not perform it, then his prayer is
still not valid even if he was ignorant. And likewise is it with Tawhīd. Even if he was
ignorant of only one type of shirk and he performed it, then he is not excused with his
ignorance and his testimony of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* is not valid until he acquires the required
knowledge and corrects his beliefs and disassociates himself from the shirk which he
performed.

This is because knowledge about Allāh and His Tawhīd is *fard ‘ayn* (an obligation upon
every single person), and no-one is excused from this obligation if he is of sane mind.

So the one who commits *shirk* and dies upon it without having repented and disassociated
himself from it and its people, he will enter Hellfire according to the promise of Allāh –
the Exalted – Who does not break His promise.

Allāh – the Exalted said:

**”Verily whoever commits *shirk*** (i.e. associates partners with Allāh in worship), **then Allāh
  has verily made Paradise forbidden for him, and his abode will be the fire. And the
  unjust will have no helpers.”** (Al-Maidah 5:72)
  
And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Verily Allāh does not forgive that partners are associated with Him** (in worship), **and
  He forgives whatever is besides that for whoever He wills. And whoever commit *shirk*
  with Allāh, then he has verily gone far astray.”** (An-Nisa 4:116)
  
And the Prophet (ﷺ) said in a sahīh hadīth narrated by Abū Hurayrah (رضي‬ الله عنه‬):

***"(On Judgment Day) a caller will call: ‘Verily every Ummah must follow what it used to
  worship (in dunyā).’ So the shayātīn, the cross and their awliyā are followed to Hellfire.
  And we will remain, O you believers. Then our Lord will come to us and say: ‘Upon what
  are these?’ So we will say: ‘We are the slaves of Allāh the believers. We have believed in
  our Lord and we did not associate anything with Him (in worship), and He is our Lord –
  tabāraka wa ta’ālā – and He will come to us and He will make us firm, and this is our
  place until our Lord will come to us.’ Then He will say: ‘I am your Lord, so go forth.’"*** (At-
  Tawhīd by Ibn Khuzaymah – with a firm and correct chain of narration)
  
So whoever dies upon *shirk* after the Qurān has reached him, he will be in Hellfire. That is
regarding his punishment in *al-ākhirah* (the hereafter). But in *dunyā* he is *mushrik* regardless
of the Qurān reaching him or not, because he worships others than Allāh and not Allāh
alone.

At-Tabarī (d. 310h) said in his tafsīr of the verse:

*"He – Exalted is His mention – says: Verily the group for whom the misguidance became a reality,
they verily went astray from the Path of Allāh and deviated from the intended goal, by taking the
shayātīn as supporters and helpers besided Allāh, due to ignorance from them regarding the mistake
they are upon in this. Rather they did this while they were thinking they are upon guidance and the 
truth, and that the correct is what they have come with and performed. And this (verse) is among
the clearest of evidences for the mistake of the opinion of the one who claims that Allāh will not
punish anyone for a sin which he performed or a misguidance which he believed in, except if he
performs (or believes in) it after having knowledge about its correct reality and then he performs it
out of stubbornness from him towards his Lord."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)

And the same meaning is found in the following verses:

**”Say: ‘Shall we inform you about the biggest losers with regards to their deeds?** (They
  are) **those whose efforts in this life were wasted while they were thinking that they
  were doing good.’”** (Al-Kahf 18:103-104)
  
At-Tabarī said in his *tafsīr* of this verse:

*"And this (verse) is among the clearest of evidences for the mistake of the opinion of the one who
  claims that no-one commits kufr to Allāh, except if he intends to commit kufr after having
  knowledge about His wahdāniyyah (oneness). And this is because Allāh – Exalted is His mention –
  informed about these people whom He described in this verse, that their efforts which they did in
  dunyā went astray, and they were verily thinking that they were doing good in this. And He
  informed that they are those who committed kufr in the verses of their Lord. And if the (correct)
  opinion were as the one who claims that no-one commits kufr to Allāh except when he knows (it is
  kufr), then this necessitates that these people (mentioned in the verse) in their deeds – which He
  informed that they were thinking that they were doing good in – were rewarded and recompensed
  for it. But the opinion is opposite of what they say. So He – Exalted is His praise – informed about
  them that they are disbelievers in Allāh, and that their deeds are in vain."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)
  
Thus, the one who excuses the *mushrik* in ignorance – or any other excuse – and declares
him a Muslim, he himself is not a Muslim due to the following:

* His testimony of _Lā ilāha illa Allāh_ is not valid since the first condition for the validity of
the testimony is knowledge. So he must know the meaning of the testimony, what it
necessitates and what contradicts it. And the person who does not know that the one who
commits _shirk_ is not a Muslim, he has in reality not known the meaning of *Lā ilāha illa
Allāh,* which is to worship Allāh alone and not ascribing partners to Him in worship.
Rather in his understanding of Islām a person can be a Muslim without rejecting *tāghūt,*
while Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”And those who avoid *tāghūt* by not worshipping it and turn in repentance to Allah, for
them are the glad tidings** (of Paradise). **So give the glad tidings to My slaves.”** (Az-Zumar
39:17)

* He has not rejected *tāghūt* which is the first pillar that must be fulfilled in order for his
testimony of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* to be valid. And this is because it is included in *al-kufr bit-
tāghūt,* to consider the one who worships *tāghūt* as a non-Muslim. And the evidence for
this is the words of Allāh the Exalted:

**”Say: ’O you disbelievers. I do not worship what you worship. Nor do you worship what I
  worship. Nor will I** (ever) **worship what you worship. Nor will you worship what I
  worship. For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.’”** (Al-Kāfirūn)
  
The Prophet (ﷺ) said about this Sūrah:

***"Verily it is the disassociation from shirk."*** (Sahīh Ibn Hibbān)

And by this we learn that the disassociation from shirk and the rejection of *tāghūt* includes:

 1. The disassociation from what is worshipped.
 **“I do not worship what you worship.”**
 2. The disassociation from the worship itself. **“For you is your religion, and for me is my religion.”** 
 And verily is the religion worship.
 3. The disassociation from the worshipper. **“Say: ’O you disbelievers.’”** 
 
* He has entered into the major *walā* (alliance, loyalty, love) with the *mushrikūn,* by
considering them as Muslim, by which the *walā* to them becomes obligatory upon him.
Having this form of *walā* is *kufr* which brings a person out of Islām, due to words of Allāh
the Exalted:

**” And whoever of you takes them as allies, then he is verily one of them. Verily Allāh
  does not guide an unjust people.”** (Al-Māidah 5:51)
  
* He (i.e. the one who considers the *mushrik* a Muslim) has furthermore rejected describing
a person with *kufr* whom Allāh has described with *kufr*. And the one who rejects even one
verse from the Qurān, he is *kāfir*.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“Yes! Verily, there came to you My *āyāt*** (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs) **and you
denied them, and were proud and were among the disbelievers.”** (Az-Zumar 39:59)

So just like declaring *takfīr* upon the *mushrik* is necessary for you in order to have fulfilled
your *kufr bit-tāghūt*, then it is naturally also necessary for the next man in order for his *kufr
bit-tāghūt* to be valid. So the *hukm* of the one who considers the *mushrik* a Muslim is that he
did not fulfill his *kufr bit-tāghūt* and therefore he has not fulfilled *Lā ilāha illa Allāh*, and by
that he is not a Muslim.


# The second pillar: *Al-Imānu billāh* (the belief in Allāh)

Believing in Allāh – in the language – means to acknowledge the presence of a Creator and
Sustainer etc. And this is the belief which is mentioned in the following verse:

**“And most of them do not believe in Allāh, except that they are mushrikūn** (i.e.
associating partners with Allāh in worship)**.”** (Yūsuf 12:106)

But this type of belief is not sufficient for becoming a Muslim, rather a Muslim must
believe in Allāh according to the Islāmic Legislation, and not just according to the
language. This belief in Allāh is called At-Tawhīd (The Oneness of Allāh). This is the type
of belief which is mentioned in the following verse:

**“Those who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice** (i.e. shirk)**, for those there
is safety and they are the rightly guided.”** (Al-An’ām 6:82)

‘Abdullāh ibn Mas’ūd (رضي‬ الله عنه‬) said:

*"When the verse: **"Those who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice** (i.e.
shirk)**, for those there is safety and they are the rightly guided."** was revealed this was hard
(to hear) for the Muslims. So they said: ‘O Messenger of Allāh, who of us does not make injustice to
himself (by sinning)?’ He said: ‘That is not what is meant. Verily it is shirk. Did you not hear what
Luqmān said to his son while he was advising him: **"O my son, do not commit shirk to Allāh.
Verily shirk is a big injustice."**"* (Sahīh Al-Bukhārī)

In order to make it easier for the people, Tawhīd has been divided into three categories
which are:

  **1. Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah*,** which means the Tawhīd of Lordship. This type of Tawhīd
  includes the slave’s belief in the actions of Allāh.
  
  **2. Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah***, which means the Tawhīd of Divinity (or Worship). This type of
  Tawhīd includes the slave’s deeds which he performs to worship Allāh.
  
  **3. Tawhīd *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt*,** which means the Tawhīd of Names and Attributes. This
  type of Tawhīd includes the descriptions of Allāhs Names and Attributes which are found
  in the Qurān and in the Sunnah.
  
Muhammad ibn Nasr Al-Marwazī (d. 294h) said when explaining *īmān*:

*"Then its asl (fundament) is the acknowledgement of the heart regarding the knowledge (about
  Allāh and His religion). And this is the submission to Allāh in the ‘ubūdiyyah (worship), and the
  submission to Him in the Rubūbiyyah (Lordship). And likewise the submission of the tongue by
  acknowledging the ilāhiyyah (divinity) by having sincerity for Him in the heart and upon the
  tongue (regarding) Him being One without any partner."* (Ta’dhīm Qadr As-Salāh by Al-
  Marwazī 2/702)
  
And Imām Ahmad ibn Hanbāl (d. 241h) said:

*"We worship Allāh by His Attributes, just as He has described Himself. He has verily outlined the
  description of Himself. And we do not transgress the Qurān and the hadīth, so we say just as they
  have said, and we describe Him just as He has described Himself and we do not transgress (or
  invalidate) this. We believe in all of the Qurān, both that of it which is clear and that which is
  doubious, and we do not remove from Him – uplifted is His mention – any Attribute from His
  Attributes."* (Al-Ibānah Al-Kubrā by Ibn Battah)
  
And Ibn Battah (d. 387 h) said:

*"And this is because the asl (foundation) of īmān in Allāh – which is obligatory upon the creation to
  believe in regarding the establishment of the belief in Him – are in three things. The first: That the
  slave believes in His Lordship in order for him to be free from the madhhab of the people of ta’tīl
  (invalidation) who do not establish (or believe in) a creator. The second: That he believes in His
  Oneness in order for him to free from the madhāhib of the people of shirk who acknowledged a
  Creator but associated others as partners with Him in worship. The third: That he believes that He
  is described with the Attributes which it is not possible except that He is described with them such
  as knowledge, capability, wisdom and the rest of what He has described Himself with in His Book.
  Since we have verily known that many of those who acknowledge Him and unify Him in worship in
  general words verily deviate in His Attributes, and then his deviation in His Attributes is a breach
  in his Tawhīd. And because we find that Allāh – the Exalted – verily has addressed His slaves by
  calling them to believing in every one of these three and the īmān in them."* (Al-Ibānah ‘an
  Sharī’ah Al-Firqah An-Nājiyah)
  
So a person cannot be a Muslim without believing in and performing all three types of
Tawhīd without associating partners with Allāh in any of these, or if he believes in them in
a way which is contradictory to what is stated in the Qurān and the *Sunnah* according to
the understanding of the *Salaf*. And verily did Allāh – the Exalted – gather all three types
of Tawhīd in His words:

**”The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, so worship Him
  and be steadfast in the worship of Him. Do you know anyone equal to Him in name (i.e.
  someone sharing His Names and Attributes)?”** (Maryam19:65)
  
At-Tabarī (d. 718h) mentioned in his *tafsīr* of the verse:

*"Bishr narrated to us and said: Yazid narrated to us and said: Sa’id narrated to us, from Qatadah
(regarding) His words:* **"Do you know anyone equal to Him in name?"** *(He said:) ‘There is
no-one equal to him in name and nor is anyone similar to Him. All of His creation acknowledge
Him and recognize that He is his creator and know this.’ Then he read this verse:* **"And if you
asked them who created them, they will verily say: ‘Allah’."** (Az-Zukhruf 43:87).‛ (Tafsīr
At-Tabarī)

The people whom the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) were sent amongst
(i.e. the *kuffār* of Quraysh), believed in Allāh, but only in some aspects of His *Rubūbiyyah*.
So they acknowledged Allāh as their Creator and Sustainer, and they performed several
types of worship for Him. But due to them worshipping the statues besides Him, by
invoking them and taking them as intermediaries between themselves and Allāh, then
Allāh rejected their socalled īmān and sent His Prophet (ﷺ) to
warn them.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”Say: ‘To whom belongs the earth and whatever is in it, if you** (really) **know?’ Then they
  will say: ‘To Allāh’. Say: ‘Will you then not be reminded?’ Say: ‘Who is the Lord of the
  seven heavens and the Lord of the Mighty Throne?’ They will say: ‘Allāh is.’ Say: ‘Will
  you then not fear** (Allāh)**?’ Say: ‘In whose Hand is the sovereignty over everything, and
  He protects while nothing protects against Him, if you really know?’ They will say:
  ‘Allāh.’ Say: ‘Then how are you deceived** (away from worshipping only Him)**?’”** (Al-
  Muminūn 23:84-89)
  
And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And if you would ask them: ‘Who sends down water from the sky with which He brings
  the earth back to life after its death?’ Then they would verily say: ‘Allāh** (does)**.’ Say: ‘All
  praise is due to Allāh, but most of them do not understand.”** (Al-‘Ankabūt 29:63)
  
So a person may claim night and day that he is a believer in Allāh, and he may perform
lots of worship for Allāh, but if his *īmān* is not according the the Islāmic Legislation so that
he has fulfilled the three types of Tawhīd, then his *īmān* is invalid and Allāh does not
accept it.

# Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah* (Tawhīd of Lordship)

Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah* is the belief in Oneness of Allāh in the Creation, the Lordship, the
Arrangement, and His Oneness in His Actions. Those who commit *shirk* believe in many
aspects of this type of Tawhīd, yet it is not enough to save them from the punishment of
Allāh, because they worship others than Allāh. This was the situation of the *kuffār*
(disbelievers) of Quraysh [Quraysh is the tribe of the Prophet (ﷺ)] which has previously been mentioned. The description of
Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah* can be found in the following verses.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“Say** (O Muhammad)**: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? And who
owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the
dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?’ They will say: ‘Allāh.’ Say: ‘Will you
not then be afraid?’ ”** (Yūnus 10:31)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Allāh is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see. Then, He rose
  above the Throne** (in a manner that suits His Majesty)**. He has subjected the sun and the
  moon, each of them running** (its course) **for a term appointed. He regulates all affairs,
  explaining the *āyāt*** (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs) **in detail, that you may
  believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord.”** (Ar-Ra’d 13:2)
  
And He – the Exalted – said:
  
**“Surely, His is the Creation and Commandment. Blessed be Allāh, the Lord of *Al- ‘Ālamīn*** (all that exists)**.”** (Al-A’rāf 7:54)
    
And He – the Exalted – said:

**“And if you asked them who created them, they will surely say: ‘Allāh’. How then are
  they turned away** (from the worship of Allāh alone)**?”** (Az-Zukhruf 43:87)
  
And this type of Tawhīd is the reason that only Allāh deserves to be worshipped and no-
one else but Him. He is our Lord and Creator, and therefore He is the one who deserves
that we worship Him. Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“O mankind, worship your Lord, Who created you and those who were before you so
  that you may become God-fearing.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:21)
  
And He – the Exalted – said:

**”That is Allāh your Lord. There is no-one worthy of worship besides Him. The Creator of
  everything, so worship Him. And He is the Disposer of all things.”** (Al-An’ām 6:102)
  
The One who Creates, Provides, Sustains, Benefits, Harms, Upholds, Maintains, Knows,
Gives life, Takes life, Legislates, Forgives, Punishes, Decrees, Protects, Cures, Clothes,
Feeds, Exposes, Hides, Honors, Humiliates, Destroys, Shows mercy and Answers His
slaves, is the One who deserves to be worshipped. And naturally those who cannot do any
of these things – and do not own any partnership with Allah nor do they help Him in any
it – are not in any way entitled that even the smallest type of worship should be dedicated
towards them. And these things mentioned above are all from the Actions of Allāh, which
are specific for Him – the Exalted – and they are the reason that He Alone is deserving of
being worshipped and no-one else but Him the Most High. He – the Exalted – said:

**”Say invoke those whom you claim (to be gods) besides Allah. They do not own** (even) **an
  atom’s weight in the heavens, nor on earth. And they do not hold any partnership** (with
  Allah) **in any of them, nor does He have any helper from among them.”** (Saba 34:22)
  
# *Shirk* in Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah*

Among the types of *shirk* which people commit in this type of Tawhīd are the following:

* Believing that something else created the creation.

* Believing that someone else than Allāh can harm or benefit, such as a person in a grave, a
living person (in things which humans are not capable of), the position of the stars on the
sky etc.

* Believing that someone else has the right to legislate for people. Legislating is the right of
Allāh and it is from His actions. So believing that someone else has this right is ascribing
him as a partner or rival with Allāh in this specific action of Allāh.

* Believing that someone besides Allāh can affect the affairs of the heavens and the earth
and whatever is in them.

* Believing that someone besides Allāh knows the unseen. Knowing the unseen is a
specific characteristic of Allāh and therefore whoever believes someone else knows what
only Allāh knows, then he has ascribed a partner or a rival to Allāh in this specific
characteristic.

Whoever ascribes anything which is from Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah* to others than Allāh then
he has committed shirk in Tawhīd *Ar-Rubūbiyyah* and by this he leaves the fold of Islām
and becomes a mushrik.


# Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah* (Tawhīd of divinity or worship)

Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah* is the realization of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh*. That which all the prophets and
messenger was sent to invite towards. And this is dedicating all types of worship solely to
Allāh and not to anyone but Him.

As for worship then it is a comprehensive term that includes all inwardly and outwardly
sayings and deeds which Allāh is pleased with and which He loves. It is the slave’s
humbleness and submissiveness towards His Lord, by performing that which He has
obliged upon him and avoiding that which He has prohibited for him. The purpose of the
creation of mankind and jinn is that they should worship Allāh Alone.

He – the Exalted – said:
    
**“And I created not the *jinn* and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).”** (Adh-Dhāriyāt 51:56)

Among the types of worship which must be directed solely to Allāh, are the following:

* *As-Salāh* (the prayer): **”And establish the prayer and give the zakah.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:43)
* *Rukū’* (bowing) and sujūd (prostrating): **”O you who believe, perform ruku’ and sujud”** (Al-Hajj 22:77)
* *Ad-Du’ā* (the invocation): **”And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me and I will answer you.’”** (Al-Ghāfir 40:60)
* *Adh-Dhabh* (the slaughtering): **”So pray to your Lord and slaughter (for Him).”** (Al-Kawthar 108:2)
* *Al-Khawf* (the fear) of Allāh: **”It is only the *Shaytān* that suggests to you the fear of his allies, so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true) believers.”** (Āli ’Imrān 3:175)
* *At-Tawakkul* (putting your trust in Allāh): **”And put your trust in Allāh if you are** (true) **believers”** (Al-Māidah 5:23)
* *Al-Istighfār* (asking for forgiveness): **”And ask your Lord for forgiveness and turn unto Him in repentance. Verily, my Lord is Most Merciful, Most Loving.”** (Hūd 11:90)
* *Al-Inābah* (turning in repentance): **”And turn in repentance to your Lord and submit yourselves to Him, before the torment comes upon you, then you will not be helped.”** (Az-Zumar 39:54)
* *Al-Isti’ādhah* (seeking refuge): **”Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the daybreak.”** (Al-Falaq 113:1)
* *Al-Jihād* (striving) with life and wealth: **”March forth, whether you are light** (being healthy, young and wealthy) **or heavy** (being ill, old and poor)**, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the Cause of Allāh.”** (At-Tawbah 9:41)
* *Al-Hukm* (the judgment) between people with what Allāh has revealed: **“And so judge** (you O Muhammad) **between them by what Allāh has revealed and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they turn you away from some of that which Allāh has revealed to you.”** (Al-Māidah 5:49)

And He – the Exalted – said: **”Surely, We have sent down to you the Book in truth that you may judge between men by that which Allāh has shown you.”** (An-Nisā 4:105)
* *At-Tahākum* (seeking judgment) from Allāh and His Messenger: **”And if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, then refer it to Allāh and His Messenger, if you believe in Allāh and in the Last Day.”** (An-Nisā 4:59)

And He – the Exalted – said: **”And in whatsoever you differ, the *hukm*** (judgment) **thereof is with Allāh.”** (Ash-Shūrā 42:10)

And He – the Exalted – said: **”But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you** (O Muhammad) **judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept** (them) **with full submission.”** (An-Nisā 4:65)

* *At-Tā’ah* (obedience) to Allāh in what He has allowed and forbidden: **”So eat from that which the Name of Allāh has been mentioned upon, if you** (truly) **believe in His verses.”** (Al-An’ām 6:118)

And He – the Exalted – said: **”Verily, He has only forbidden the *maytah*** (dead animals) **for you, the blood, the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allāh.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:173)

So it is obedience – and thereby an act of worship – to consider what Allāh has made allowed as being allowed, and what Allāh has made forbidden as being forbidden.

* And from the types of worship are also: Loving for the sake of Allāh and hating for the
sake of Allāh, giving for the sake of Allāh and withholding for the sake of Allāh, allying
for the sake of Allāh and having enmity for the sake of Allāh, *Ar-Raghbah* (the wishing or
longing), *Ar-Rahbah* (awe), *Al-Istighāthah* (asking for help), *Ash-Shukr* (gratitude), *Tilawatul-
Qurān* (reciting the Qur’an), *Dhikr Allāh* (remembrance of Allāh) and *As-Siyām* (the fast)
and other than this.

# *Shirk* in Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah*

*Shirk* in Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah* is dedicating some of the above mentioned types of worship
– or others than these – to someone else than Allāh. And among the types of *shirk* which
are widespread today are:

* Making *du’ā* to dead people in the graves. And the conditions for a du’ā (invocation,
question, request) not being *shirk*, is that the one who is asked is (1) alive, (2) capable of
what he is asked and (3) present at the time. If one of these three conditions are not present
then the du’ā is *shirk* and takes the person out of Islām. Exactly what he asks the dead for
is not important and does not determine whether or not is it *shirk*, since the dead is not
able to do anything anyway.
* Making *du’ā* to the angels.
* Seeking refuge or protection with others than Allāh.
* Slaughtering for others than Allāh.
* Voting in democratic elections and thereby giving the right to legislate to others than
Allāh.
* Seeking judgment in disputes with the courts that judges with manmade law.
* Believing something forbidden is allowed, or that something allowed is forbidden, based
upon desires, traditions, others legislations than the *Sharī’ah* or the sayings of men. This is
*shirk* in obedience.
* Striving in the cause of *tāghūt*, such as being a policeman or soldier for *tāghūt*.
* Aiding the *kuffār* against the Muslims with wealth, advice or weapons.

So whoever ascribes anything which is classified as worship in the Islāmic legislation to
others than Allāh then he has committed shirk in Tawhīd *Al-Ulūhiyyah* and by this he
leaves the fold of Islām and becomes a *mushrik*.


# Tawhid *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt* (Tawhīd of Names and Attributes)

Tawhid *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt* is the belief in the descriptions of Allāh which has come in the
Qurān and the *ahādīth* from the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) and the
sayings of the *Sahābah* (رضي‬ الله عنهم‬) and those who narrated from them, without
denying it, without distorting its meanings, without comparing Allāh with the creation
and without describing how. Rather a person must believe in what has been described in
the way it has been described, and accept the narrations as they have been narrated in
order to avoid falling in *shirk* or *bida’* (innovation) in this type of Tawhīd. The basis for
this, are the words of Allāh – the Exalted – who said:

**“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.”** (Ash-Shūrā 42:11)

So whatever Allāh or His Messenger (ﷺ) and the *Sahābah* (رضي‬ الله عنهم‬) has informed us about, regarding the description of Allāh, then Allāh
is alone in this description and He is not equal to His creation in any of it, even though
some words might be used for both Allāh and the slave, such as a *Karīm* (Generous) Lord
and a *karīm* (generous) man. Because the generosity of the man is limited to what Allāh
has given him and dependent upon the decree of Allāh, while the Generosity of Allāh is
unlimited, unrestrained and He spends out of His bounty on whom He wants however He
wants.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allāh, so call on Him by them, and leave those
who deny** (or utter impious speech against) **His Names. They will be recompensed for what they used to do.” **(Al-A’rāf 7:180)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Say** (O Muhammad)**: ‘Invoke Allāh or invoke Ar-Rahmān** (the Most Benificent)**. No matter
by which Name you invoke Him, then to Him belong the Best Names.’”** (Al-Isrā 17:110)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“He is Allāh, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms. To Him belong the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”** (Al-Hashr 59:24)

And He – the Exalted – said:

**“Say** (O Muhammad)**: ‘He is Allāh,** (the) **One. Allāh is As-Samad** (The Self-Sufficient Master,
  Whom all creatures need, while He needs no-one)**. He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is no equal to Him.’”** (Al-Ikhlās 112)
  
Some of Allāhs Names and Attributes are known from the *fitrah*, such as Allāh being the
Creator who is Capable of everything, the Disposer of affairs, the Legislator, that Allāh
Sees and Hears, that Allāh Speaks whenever He wishes, that Allāh has Knowledge about
everything, that Allāh has Life, that Allāh is in *‘Uluw* (i.e. above the heavens separated
from His creation) and similar to these things which describe Allāh with attributes of
perfection and negate any flaws, mistakes or deficiency for Him the Exalted. Whoever
rejects any of these or claims to ignorant about them, he is *kāfir*.

Then there are other things about Allāh which only can be known through a text from
either the Qurān or *Sunnah* or the sayings of the *Sahābah*. These are things such as Allāh
descending to the lowest heaven every night, Allāh sits, Allāh laughs, Allāh has a flank
and a chest, Allāh becomes amazed etc. These are things which can only be known
through the texts and therefore whoever rejects or is ignorant about these does not become
a *kāfir* until the evidence is established upon him. Many of these issues the scholars spoke
of in their explanation and clarification of the *Sunnah*, which is mentioned in this book
under the second testimony of ***Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh***, due to them being mentioned
in the *Sunnah* of the Prophet (ﷺ) or in the words of the* Sahābah* (رضي‬ الله عنهم‬).

And regarding the Tawhīd of *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt* there are some points which must be
understood in order for the slave to fulfill this type of Tawhīd in its desired form and
which prove the correct understanding and implementation of this type of Tawhīd.

**1) The Tawhīd of *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt* and establishing the Attributes is from the
  *muhkamāt* (clear issues) and not from the *mutashābihāt* (unclear or doubious issues),
  and it is from the issues of *ijmā’* (scholarly agreement) and not from the issues of
  *ikhtilāf* (disagreement).**
  
Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And Allāh spoke to Musa directly.”** (An-Nisā 4:164)

In this verse the Attribute of speaking *(kallama)* is confirmed with the root of the verb (i.e.
*taklīman*), and in the Arabic language that which is confirmed with the root is impossible
to interpret to something else than the apparent meaning of the word. And this is a well-
known fact even among the leaders of misguidance which they themselves affirm when
they speak about the Arabic language.

Based upon this it is not allowed to interpret the Names and Attributes of Allāh to
something else than their apparent meanings since they have been mentioned in a clear
and clarified way in the Book of Allāh and the *Sunnah* of His Messenger (ﷺ). Furthermore, there does not exist even one word from the *Salaf* in which they
allow interpreting the Names and Attributes to something else than their apparent
meanings, or to claim that they are metaphorical and should not be understood according
to their apparent meanings. So this also proves that this issue is an issue of *ijmā’* in which
there is no disagreement at all.

Ibn Battah (d. 387h) said:

*"Verily the people of establishing (the Attributes) from the people of Sunnah are in agreement upon
  the acknowledgement of Tawhīd and the Risālah (Message); that the īmān is in speech, deeds and
  intention and that the Qurān is the Word of Allāh and not created. And they agree upon that
  whatever Allāh wants will be and whatever He does not want will never be, that Allāh has created
  both the good and evil and predestined it, that Allāh is seen on the Day of Resurrection, that
  Paradise and Hellfire are two creations which will remain by Allāh letting them remain, that Allāh
  is upon His Throne separated from His creation and His knowledge encompasses everything, that
  Allāh is Eternal and has no beginning, no end and (His capabilities, Deeds and Attributes have) no
  boundaries. With His perfect Attributes He has always been knowledgable, speaking, hearing,
  seeing, alive and forbearing. He knows what will be before it is, and (they agreed) that He
  predestined the destinies before everything was created. And they are in agreement regarding the
  leadership (after the death of the Prophet (ﷺ)) of Abū Bakr, ‘Umar,
  ‘Uthmān and ‘Alī (رضي‬ الله عنهم‬), and upon the preference of the two Shaykh (Abū Bakr and
  ‘Umar) and that the ten are in Paradise will full certainty and no doubt regarding it. And they are
  in agreement regarding the tarahhum (asking for mercy) upon all the Companions of the Messenger
  of Allāh (ﷺ) and asking for forgiveness for them, his wives, his children
  and the people of his household, and not mentioning any of these except with good while refraining
  from and not looking into the disputes between them. So this (i.e. what has been mentioned) and
  what is similar to it is from that which has a long explanation and the people since Allāh sent His
  Prophet (ﷺ) until this time of ours are in agreement regarding this, in
  the east of the earth and in the west of it, in its seas and on its land, on its flat parts and in its
  mountains. The scholars and narrators of the āthār (narrations) narrate it and (so do) the people of
  information, the people of manners and intelligence know it, and men, women, old, young, children,
  the young people from both the city and the desert, the Arabs and the non-Arabs all agree on this.
  No-one disagrees with this, rejects it or deviates from the agreement of the people regarding this
  except a dirty, deviant, innovative, hated, forsaken, repelled man whom the scholars disasscociate
  from and the intelligent cut off. If he is sick they do not visit him and if he dies they do not witness
  his burial."* (Al-Ibānah ‘an Sharī’ah Al-Firqah An-Nājiyah)
  
So here it is clearly seen that the issues of the Names and Attributes of Allāh are
considered included in the issues of agreement among both the scholars and also the
regular of the Muslims.

**2) The way of *Ahlus-Sunnah* is establishing the mentioned Attribute in the Book and
  the *Sunnah* according to its real meaning, without *tahrīf* (distortion), *ta’tīl*
  (invalidation), *takyīf* (explaining) and *tamthīl* (comparing).**
  
Allah – the Exalted – said: **“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.”** (Ash-Shūrā 42:11)

In this verse the negation of the four forbidden things can be found. Because His words:
**"There is nothing like Him"**, negates *takyīf* and *tamthīl* which is that the slaves explains
the condition of the Attribute of Allāh or that he compares the Attribute by saying ‘A
Hand just like a hand’, or ‘Sight just like a sight’. And His words: **"And He is the All-
Hearer, the All-Seer"** negates *tahrīf* and ta’tīl, which is that the slave claims that the Sight
of Allāh means His knowledge or that he completely rejects that Allah can see.

Ibn Mājishun (d. 18:h) said:

*"Know – may Allāh have mercy upon you – that the protection in the religion is stopping in
  religion where it stops with you and not to transgress that which has been limited for you. Because
  it is verily from the foundation of the religion to know the good and reject the evil. So whatever has
  been explained to you of knowledge and the hearts find tranquility in it – while its foundation have
  been mentioned in the Book and the Sunnah and the Ummah has inherited its knowledge – then do
  not fear any blame for mentioning it and its description from your Lord of what He has described
  Himself with. And do not feel burdened by what He has described to you of that. And whatever
  your soul rejects and you do not find the mention of it in the Book of your Lord nor in the hadīth
  from your Prophet (ﷺ) – of the mention of the description of your Lord –
  then do not burden your mind with the knowledge of it, and do not describe it with your tongue.
  Remain silent about it just like the Lord has remained silent about it regarding Himself. For verily
  burdening yourself with the knowledge of what He has not described Himself with is just like
  rejecting that which He has described. So just like you consider it a big thing what the rejectors
  have rejected of what He has described Himself with, then likewise consider it a big thing to burden
  ones self with what the describers have described of that which He has not described himself with."*
  (Al-Ibānah Al-Kubrā by Ibn Battah)
  
And Ibn Battah (d. 287h) said:

*"‚Know – may Allah have mercy upon you – that from the characteristics of the believers among the
  people of the truth is to believe in the correct narrations, receiving them with acceptance and to
  refrain from opposing them with qiyās (analogy) and forming a view based upon opinions and
  desires. For verily is belief to accept and the believer is the one who accepts. Allah – ‘azza wa jalla –
  said: **"But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you** (O Muhammad)
  **judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your
  decisions, and accept** (them) **with full submission."** (An-Nisā 4:65) So from the signs of the
  believers is that they describe Allah with what He has described Himself with and with what His
  Messenger (ﷺ) has described Him with from that which the scholars have
  conveyed, and what the trustworthy people of narration have narrated; those who are the hujjah
  (argument) in what they narrated of halal, haram, the sunan and the athar. And regarding that
  which has been correctly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) it is
  not said ‘how?’ nor ‘why?’, rather they follow and do not innovate, and they submit themselves and
  do not oppose, and they believe with certainty and they do not doubt nor are they skeptical."* (Al-
  Ibānah Al-Kubrā by Ibn Battah)
  
When it came to the Names and Attributes of Allāh the *Salaf* would say: ‘Let the narration
pass (i.e. accept it) just as it has been narrated’ – as it will be mentioned later – and thus
they became safe in their religion.  

**3) The Prophet (ﷺ) and the *Salaf* would point towards the
attribute as an affirmation of the real meaning of the Attribute while negating that it
should be metaphorical. And this prohibits that the Attribute can be interpreted
according to *ijtihād*, opinion and analogy or claiming that they are metaphorical.**

This means that the Prophet (ﷺ) would point at the time of
speaking at – for example – his ear or his eye, or indicate with his hand or finger
dependant upon which Attribute he (ﷺ) was describing, not by
way of *tamthīl* (comparing) rather by way of affirming the Attribute and verifying it. And
this occur many places in the *ahādīth* and narrations.

*"’Alī ibn Nasr and Muhammad ibn Yūnus An-Nasāī Al-Ma’nā narrated to us and said: ‘Abdullāh
  ibn Yazīd Al-Muqrī narrated to us (and said): Harmalah (i.e. ibn ‘Imrān) narrated to us (and said):
  Abū Yūnus Sulaym ibn Jubayr the mawlā of Abū Hurayrah narrated to me and said: I heard Abū
  Hurayrah recite this verse: **"Verily Allāh commands you to return trusts to their rightful
  owners."** Until His words: **"All-Hearing, All-Seeing."** (An-Nisā 4:58) He (Abū Hurayrah)
  said: ‘I saw the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) put his thumb upon his ear and
  the (finger) that follows it upon his eye.’ Abū Hurayrah said: ‘I saw the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) recite it and put his two fingers.’ Ibn Yūnus said: Al-Muqrī said:
  ‘Verily Allāh is All-Hearing and All-Seeing means, that Allah has hearing and sight.’ Abū Dāwūd
  said: ‘And this is a refutation of the Jahmiyyah.’"* (Sunan Abū Dāwūd)
  
Ibn Mājah (d. 273h) narrated:

*"‚Hishām ibn ‘Ammār and Muhammad ibn As-Sabbāh narrated to us and said: ‘Abdul-‘Azīz ibn
  Abī Hāzim narrated to us (and said): Abū ‘Ubayd-Allāh ibn Miqsam narrated to me from
  ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say
  while he was standing upon the pulpit: **"Al-Jabbār will take His heavens and His earths in
  His Hand"** – and he grasped with his hand and began to grasp and unfold it – **and then He will
  say: I am Al-Jabbār, I am the King. Where are the oppressors, where are the arrogant?"** He
  said: And the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) was swaying from his right to his
  left until I saw the pulpit moving from below it until I said (to myself): Is it going to fall with the
  Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ)?’"* (Sunan Ibn Mājah)
  
Imām Ahmad (d. 781h) said:

*"Abū Al-Muthannā Mu’ādh ibn Mu’ādh narrated to us, from Hammād ibn Salamah, from Thābit
Al-Bunānī, from Anas ibn Mālik (رضي‬ الله عنه‬) from the Prophet (ﷺ) regarding His – ‘azza wa jalla – words: **"So when his Lord appeared to the mountain
He made it collapse to dust."** (Al-A’rāf 7:143) He said: He (ﷺ) said:
***"Like this (i.e. he exposed the tip of the little finger)."*** My father said: ‚Mu’ādh showed us
how (with his little finger), so Humayd At-Tāwil said to him: ‘Why are you doing like that, O Abū
Muhammad?’ He said: So he struck his chest with a hard strike and said: ‘Who are you O Humayd
and what are you O Humayd? Anas ibn Mālik narrated it to me from the Prophet (ﷺ) and you are saying: Why are you doing that?"* (Musnad Imām Ahmad)

Abdullāh ibn Ahmad (d. 290h) said:

*"I heard my father – (رحمه الله) – say: From Yahyā ibn Sa’īd the hadīth of Sufyān, from Al-
  A’mash, from Mansūr, from Ibrāhīm, from ’Ubaydah, from ’Abdullāh, from the Prophet (ﷺ): **"That Allāh will hold the heavens upon one Finger."** My father – (رحمه الله) – said: ‘Yahyā began to show with his fingers.’ And my father showed me how he
  began to show with his fingers putting one finger upon another finger until he came to the last of
  them."* (Kitāb As-Sunnah by ‘Abdullāh)
  
So all these narrations show how the *Salaf* would affirm the real meaning of the Attribute
which necessitates the impossibility of interpreting the Attributes according to something else than their actual meanings or explainging their condition without a proof.

Ad-Dārimī (d. 280h) said:

*"Regarding what you have mentioned of ijtihād regarding the condition of the Attributes of the
  Lord, then we verily do not allow ijtihād of opinion in many issues of the farāid (obligatory acts of
  worship) and the judgments which we see with our eyes and hear with our ears. Then how (should
  we allow it) regarding the Attributes of the Lord which the eyes have not seen and the assumptions
  have been cut off from?"* (An-Naqd by Ad-Dārimī)
  
And Ibn Mandah (d. 395h) said:

*"And likewise we say regarding what has gone forth of these narrations regarding the Attributes in
  this book of ours; (that) we narrate them without tamthīl (giving examples), tashbīh (comparing),
  takyīf (explainging), qiyās (analogy) and tawīl (interpretation), according to what the truthful Salaf
  conveyed from the pure Sahābah from Al-Mustafā (ﷺ). And we declare
  as ignorant whoever speaks about them except with a clear proof from the Messenger (ﷺ) or a narration from a Sahābī who was present at (the time of) the revelation."*
  (Kitāb At-Tawhīd by Ibn Mandah)
  

# *Shirk* in Tawhīd *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt*

*Shirk* in Tawhid *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt* is making someone equal to Allāh – the Exalted – in
anything from His Names and Attributes, or to describe Allāh with any of the attributes of
the creation. So whoever describes someone from the creation with any of Allāh Names
and Attributes while believing that this created being or thing, holds the meaning of the
attribute which is specific for Allāh, then he is *mushrik* in *Al-Asmā was-Sifāt*. Such as the
one who describes a person as being hearing while believing he can hear everything just
like Allāh hears everything, or that he can hear from a distance or under circumstances in
which a normal human-bring cannot hear.

Some of the types of *shirk* that people perform, in this type of Tawhīd are the following:

* Deriving names for false deities from the Names of Allāh such as Al-Lāt from Al-Ilāh,
and Al’Uzzā from Al-‘Azīz.
* The belief of some **Sūfiyyah** and **Rawāfid** that theirs *shuyūkh* and *awliyā* can hear their
*du’ā* (invocation) no matter where they are.
* The belief of the *Mushabbihah* who compare the Creator with the creation. An example
of this is:

Allāh – the Exalted – said: **”Rather His two Hands are wide outstretched. He spends however He wills.”** (Al-Māidah 5:64)

Then the **Mushabbih** says: ‚The Hands of Allāh are like the hands of the creation‛, and thereby they make Allāh equal to the creation in this Attribute of Allāh.

* The *manhaj* of the **Jahmiyyah** who rejected the Names and attributes of Allāh and
distorted their meanings and thereby described Him – the Exalted – with deficiency and
nothingness, while claiming to flee from comparing the Creator with the created. Included
here are every sect who might go under a different name, but rejects and distorts the
meanings of the Names and Attributes of Allāh.

Hammād ibn Zayd (d. 179h) said:

*"The example of the Jahmiyyah is like a man to whom it was said: ‘Is there a palm tree in your
  residence?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ It was said: ‘Does it have leaves?’ He said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does it
  then have fronds?’ He said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does it then have a stem?’ He said: ‘No.’ It was said:
  ‘Does it then have a trunk?’ He said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does it then have a root?’ He said: ‘No.’ It
  was said: ‘Then there is no palm tree in your residence.’ It was said to these Jahmiyyah: ‘Do you
  have a lord?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ It was said: ‘Does he speak?’ They said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does he
  have a hand?’ They said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does he then have a foot?’ They said: ‘No.’ Does he then
  have a finger?’ They said: ‘No.’ It was said: ‘Does he become pleased or angry?’ They said: ‘No.’ It
  was said: ‘Then you do not have a lord.’"* (Sharh Madhāhib Ahlus-Sunnah by Ibn Shāhin)
  
Al-Bukhārī (d. 256h) said:

*"And some from the people of knowledge said: ’Verily the Jahmiyyah they are (in reality) the
  Mushabbihah [Those who compares the Creator with the creation]. Because they compared their Lord with the statues, the deaf and the mute which
  cannot hear, cannot see and cannot speak and cannot create."* (Khalq Af’āl Al-‘Ibād p. 111)
  
And Ad-Dārimī (d. 280h) said regarding the Jahmiyyah:

*"And we also declare takfīr upon them due to what is well-known of their kufr; that they do not
  establish (i.e. believe in) for Allāh – the Exalted – a Face, Hearing, Seeing, Knowledge, Speech nor
  (any) attribute, except with the interpretation of misguided people who have been exposed and their
  mistakes have become clear. They say: ‘His Hearing, Seeing, Knowledge and Speech are with the
  same meaning. And He Himself is everywhere, in every closed house and every locked box.’ Verily 
  did – according to their claim – its walls, its bars and its locks surround Him. So to Allāh we
  declare ourselves free from an ilāh who has this description. And this is also a clear reason for
  declaring takfīr upon them."* (Ar-Rad ‘alā Al-Jahmiyyah by Ad-Dārimī p.182)
  
Ad-Dārimī (d. 280h) also said when speaking about Bishr Al-Marīsī who was one of the leaders of the Jahmiyyah:

*"And the strange thing from Al-Marisi – the owner of this madhhab – is that he claims (to believe
  in) the Tawhid of Allah with this madhhab and what is similar to it, while he verily invalidated all
  the Attributes of Al-Wahid Al-Ahad. So he claimed according to the measurements of his madhhab
  that the one whom he worships as an ilah is limbless, imperfect, disfigured and incomplete and that
  his Oneness is not fulfilled except through a created being, nor is he free of needing created things
  such as speech, knowledge and name. Woe to you, verily the truthful muwahhid in his Tawhid is
  the one who unifies Allah in His Perfection and in all of His Attributes, in His knowledge, His
  speech, His grasp, His outstretch (of Hands), His descent, His ascension; the One who is in no need
  of His creation in all of His Attributes among the Being, the Face, the Hearing, the Seeing, the two
  Hands, the Knowledge, the Speech, the Capability, the Mashīah, the Authority, the Withholder, the
  Extender, the Bestower of honor, the Humiliator, the Living, the Subsisting and the One who does
  whatever He wants. This person is closer to Tawhid than this person who unifies a limbless,
  imperfect and incomplete god; if he were a slave with this description then he would not have been
  worth two dates. So how can someone similar to it be the god of all the worlds? Exalted is Allah far
  above this description."* (Naqd Ad-Dārimī)

# Other nullifiers which have not been mentioned

There are a few nullifier of Islām which has not yet been mentioned. These are:

* Al-Istihzā (mocking) and As-Sabb (cursing). This includes mocking, belittling or cursing at
anything from the religion of Islām.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And if you asked them, they will verily say: ‘We were only conversing and playing.’ Say:
  ‘Is it Allāh, His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking? Do not come with
  excuses, you have verily committed *kufr* after your īmān.”** (At-Tawbah 9:65-66)
  
And He – the Exalted said:

**“And when he knows something of Our verses he makes fun of it. For those there is a
  humiliating punishment.”** (Al-Jāthiyah 45:9)
    
Ishāq ibn Rāhūyah (d. 77<h) said:

*"The Muslims have agreed upon that the one who curses at Allāh, or curses at His Messenger
 (ﷺ), or denies anything from what Allāh – ‘azza wa jalla – has revealed,
 or kills a prophet among the prophets of Allāh, that he is kāfir by doing that, even if he
 acknowledges everything which Allāh has revealed."* (At-Tamhīd by Ibn ‘Abdul-Barr)
 
* *As-Sihr* (black magic), which is the agreement between a magician and a *shaytān* (a devil
 among the *jinn*), that the magician will perform some acts of worship for the *shaytān* who
 in return will help him or obey him in what he demands from him.
 
Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**“And they followed what the *shayātīn* recited in the reign of Sulaymān. And Sulaymān
did not disbelieve, rather the *shayātīn* disbelieved. They taught the people magic and
what was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Hārūt and Mārūt.”** (Al-Baqarah 2:102)

And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

*"He is not from us the one who gives omens or has omens done for him, or he foretells or someone
 foretells for him, or he performs magic or magic is performed for him. And whoever goes to a
 foreteller and believes in what he says, then he has committed kufr in what was revealed to
 Muhammad (ﷺ)."* (Al-Bazzār – with a good isnād)
 
In order to achieve the cooperation of the *shaytān* the magician has to perform deed such
as asking the *shayātīn* for help, invoking them in things which they are not capable of, utter
words of *kufr* in order to please them, slaughter for them, or mock some of things which
Allāh has ordered to venerate such as the Qurān and other things, all of which is clear *kufr*
from the one performing it. Add to these things if the one doing it or has it done for him
believes that the *shayātīn* can benefit or harm without the permission of Allah or that they
know the unseen.

So whoever performs magic according to what is described above, or has magic performed
for him or is pleased with any of what has been mentioned, then he is *kāfir* according to
what has already gone forth of evidences and principles of the religion.

* *Al-I’rād* (turning away), which is the *kufr* that consist of turning away from learning the
religion and performing what it necessitates and requires of the slave.

Allāh – the Exalted – said:

**”And those who disbelieve turn away from what they were warned against.”** (Al-Ahqāf
  46:3)
  
At-Tabarī (d. 310h) said in his *tafsīr* of the verse:

*"And His words: **"And those who disbelieve turn away from what they were warned
  against."** He – Exalted is His mention – says: ‘And those who rejected the Oneness of Allāh are
  turning away from the warning of Allāh to them. They do not take a warning, nor do they think,
  nor do they take a lesson."* (Tafsīr At-Tabarī)
  
And He – the Exalted – said:

**“So he did not believe nor did he pray. Rather he rejected and he turned away.”** (Al-
  Qiyāmah 75:31-32)
  
And the Prophet (ﷺ) said:

***"By the One whose Hand Muhammad’s soul is in, no-one from this Ummah, neither a Jew
   nor a Christian hears about me, and then do not believe in what I have been sent with,
   except that he is from the people of the fire."*** (Sahīh Muslim)
   
   Everyone today who does not know the fundamental principles of Islām, nor does he
   perform the obligatory acts of worship due to not having sought to learn it, then he is not
   considered to be ignorant because the knowledge is present and accessible, rather he is
   considered to be among those who turned away from learning the religion of Allah, which
   is *kufr*.
   
   
# The second testimony: Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh

The testimony of ***Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh*** includes the belief in the Prophethood of
Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib ibn Hāshim ibn ‘Abdi-Manāf ibn Qusayy
ibn Kilāb ibn Murrah ibn Ka’b ibn Luay ibn Ghālib ibn Fihr ibn Mālik ibn An-Nadr ibn
Kinānah ibn Khuzaymah ibn Mudrikah ibn Ilyās ibn Mudar ibn Nazār ibn Ma’ad ibn
‘Adnān, and ‘Adnān is among the children of Ismā’īl ibn Ibrāhīm (عليه السلام), and
that he (ﷺ) is the Messenger of Allāh. This includes:

1. The general belief in his (ﷺ) Message to all created beings, both jinn and mankind.
2. The belief in that he (ﷺ) is the last messenger and that his Message is the seal of all the messages.
3. The belief in that his (ﷺ) Message abrogates all previous messages and legislations.
4. The belief in that he (ﷺ) conveyed the Message in its entirety, he fulfilled the amānah (trust), he gave advice to his Ummah until he left it on a clear path whose night is like its day.
5. The belief in that he (ﷺ) is protected in what he conveys from Allāh the Exalted.
6. The belief in what he (ﷺ) deserves of rights, such as loving him, respecting him, honoring him and holding him at high esteem.
7. The belief that he (ﷺ) is dead and buried in Madīnah.

The testimony of ***Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh*** furthermore includes believing in everything which he (ﷺ) informed about, and the obedience of him in what he ordered. This is because whatever the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) has informed about, regarding Allāh, His religion or the unseen, then this is revelation from
Allāh the Exalted, based upon His – the Exalted – words:

**“By the star when it descends. Your companion** (i.e. Muhammad) **has not gone astray nor
  has he erred. And he does not speak from** (his own) **desire. Rather it is revelation being
  revealed.”** (An-Najm 53:1-4)
  
So whatever he (ﷺ) has informed about and established, then it is obligatory to establish it and believe in it, and whatever he negated, then it is obligatory to 
negate it. Thus it is obligatory for the believers to establish and believe in everything
which the Messenger of Allāh informed about, regarding the Names and Attributes of
Allāh. Likewise they must negate for Him whatever he negated for Allāh, such as
similarity with the created being, and in this way they become free from ta’tīl
(invalidating), *takyīf* (explaining), *tashbīh* (comparing) and *tahrīf* (distorting).

Furthermore there is no legislation, except the legislation which the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) came with. Thus, accepting another legislation than the
Sharī’ah is a breach of both the testimony of *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* and the testimony of *Muhammadun Rasūl-Allāh*. Allāh – the Exalted – says:

**“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you** (O Muhammad) **judge
  in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your
  decisions, and accept** (them) **with full submission.”** (An-Nisā 4:65)
  
So the true believers believe in the Messenger (ﷺ) in what he has
informed about Allāh, the Last Day, Islām, Īmān and Ihsān, and they obey him (ﷺ) in what he has ordered and forbidden, they consider allowed what he
has allowed and consider forbidden what he has forbidden, and they adopt the true
religion based upon the Qurān and the *Sunnah*. Because there is no good except that the
Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) has ordered it and no evil except that he forbade it.

The ahādīth of the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) are referred to as the *Sunnah*. In the *Sunnah* issues from both the *usūl* (fundamental principles) of the religion
and the *furū’* (branches) of the religion can be found. And no-one is saved from *bida’*
(innovation) except the person who bases his religion upon the Qurān and the *Sunnah*.

After the death of the Messenger (ﷺ), the groups of innovation such as the Khawārij, the Qadariyyah, the Murjiah, the Rāfidah, the Jahmiyyah and the
Mu’tazilah emerged, and the people of truth became distinguished by a name indicating
that they remained upon what the Messenger of Allāh (ﷺ) came with; this name was ***Ahlul-Hadīth*** (the people of *hadīth*) or ***Ahlus-Sunnah***. And the
responsibility of aligning ones belief with the *understanding* of the *Salaf* is an individual
obligation which no-one is free from adhering to.
