## Contributing
 - Issues and PullRequests welcome
 > We welcome and encourage all pull requests. But first:<br>
    1. Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using `Reformat Code` feature of Android Studio `CMD`+`Option`+`L` on Mac and `CTRL` + `ALT` + `L` on Linux + Windows .<br>
    2. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.<br>
    3. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)<br>
    4. Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.<br>
    5. Check for existing issues first, before filing an issue.<br>
    6. Make sure you follow the set standard as all other projects in this repo do<br>
    7. Keep calm and make it easy.<br>
